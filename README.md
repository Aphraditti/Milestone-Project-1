# Milestone-Project-1 
The inspiration behind Aphra’s Trivia Game is the popular Television show “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire”. It is a one player game and there are over 10 categories that randomly generate. Once you load the browser you have to input how many random trivia questions you would like to be asked, and there are over 1000 questions so the game can go on for long period of time. In order to start over the browser would have to be refreshed.  The www.opentdb.com API generator was used to generate the trivia questions and the difficulty level for each category. The www.fonts.google.com was used to select the font(s) type. The www.pixabay.com was used to select mp3 background sound when browser is loaded.
